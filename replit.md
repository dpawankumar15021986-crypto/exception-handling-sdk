# Exception Handling SDK

## Overview

This is a comprehensive Java SDK designed to standardize exception handling across different types of exceptions including checked, unchecked, system errors, and HTTP status codes. The SDK provides a unified approach to exception management with configurable handling strategies, structured logging, and standardized error response formats. It's built to be a reusable library that can be integrated into Java applications to provide consistent error handling patterns.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Exception Hierarchy
The SDK implements a comprehensive exception hierarchy with base exception classes that include built-in error IDs, timestamps, and contextual information. This provides a standardized foundation for all exception types in the system.

### Exception Type Support
The architecture supports multiple exception categories:
- Checked exceptions for anticipated error conditions
- Unchecked exceptions for runtime errors
- System errors for infrastructure-level issues
- HTTP status code exceptions for web service integration

### Handler Configuration System
The SDK uses a flexible handler configuration system that allows customizable exception handling strategies. This enables applications to define their own handling logic while maintaining consistency.

### Logging Integration
Built-in integration with SLF4J provides structured logging capabilities with contextual information automatically included in log entries.

### Context Management
Thread-safe context storage system allows additional error metadata to be attached to exceptions without cluttering the main exception structure.

### Response Format System
Standardized error response models support multiple output formats including JSON, XML, plain text, and structured maps, making the SDK suitable for various types of applications.

### Builder Pattern Implementation
Fluent APIs using builder patterns provide easy configuration and exception creation, improving developer experience and code readability.
